# Soft UI Dashboard

Demo of the application can be found [here](https://soft-dashboard.netlify.app/) (currently, only available on the desktop view)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
